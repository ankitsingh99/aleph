//! Usage / rate limits: an agent that stopped because its plan's limit was
//! hit says so on screen ("5-hour limit reached ∙ resets 2:40am", "You've hit
//! your usage limit … try again in 2 hours", "exhausted your daily quota").
//! The fleet reads the last lines of idle sessions now and then (`fleet.rs`)
//! and `detect` decides; the session then shows "◷ at limit · resets 2:40am".
//!
//! Only strong, specific phrasings count (an agent *talking about* rate
//! limits in code shouldn't), warnings ("approaching", "85% used", "heads
//! up") and notices that the agent carried on (a fallback model, auto mode,
//! extra usage) don't, and only the last lines of the screen are looked at.
//! The phrases are each agent's own, read from their source where it's open
//! (Claude Code's bundle, codex-rs, gemini-cli, qwen-code, opencode, cline,
//! …) and their issue trackers where it isn't (Antigravity, Cursor) —
//! checked 2026-10-25.
